      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        At <strong>AgroHub</strong>, we believe farming is more than just cultivation —
        it’s the heart of our communities and the key to a sustainable future.
        Yet, modern farmers face daunting challenges: climate change, shrinking
        resources, and unpredictable pest outbreaks. That’s why we created
        <strong>AgroHub</strong> — an innovative, AI-powered platform built to empower
        farmers with data-driven insights and smart tools for every season.

        automation, AgroHub helps farmers make informed decisions, conserve water,
        improve soil health, and achieve higher yields — all while protecting the
        environment.
